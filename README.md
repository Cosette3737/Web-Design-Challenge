> With the help of html and Css Styling we are able to take the data collected on Weather patterns of various locations and analyze how they are affected by lattitude.
This project created a website using a previous data set and images created in PANDAS, JUPYTER notebook, MATPLOTLIB to visualize and share these patterns. The website contains a latitude home page, 4 plot pages, a data page and also a comparison page.  These pages are responsive to how they are being displayed.
